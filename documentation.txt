                         Ham Radio Tuning Aid
                         ====================
                   Jeff Tranter <tranter@pobox.com>

OVERVIEW

This is a tuning aid, designed to assist in tuning up CW and SSB
amateur radio transmitters and limiting the risk of damage by
transmitting at a low duty cycle. It is similar to the "Woodpecker"
Tuning Aid described in reference [2]. This design is unique in that
it includes both SSB and CW tuning aid circuits in a single unit.

The design is flexible and can be assembled in different ways
depending on what features are needed.

It is Open Source Hardware licensed under the The TAPR Open Hardware
License. You are welcome to build the circuit, and if desired use my
PCB layout.

FEATURES

1. Outputs for SSB and CW transmitters.
2. Contained on one small PCB.
3. Intended to be battery powered by a 9 volt battery.
4. Uses all through-hole components.
5. Adjustable SSB output level.
6. Adjustable CW frequency and duty cycle.
7. Can key CW transmitters with positive or negative keying up to 60 V
   200 mA.

OPERATION

P1 is connected to the microphone input of a SSB transmitter. P2 is
connected to the key input of a CW transmitter.

The power switch turns the unit on, illuminating the power LED (if
installed).

Pressing the TONE switch will send a low duty cycle audio tone out the
SSB output. Adjust the LEVEL potentiometer for the desired output
level.

Pressing the CW switch will key the transmitter at a low duty cycle (a
series of dots). Adjust the SPEED and RATIO potentiometers to adjust
the speed and duty cycle. The KEY switch, if used, will key the
transmitter on continuously when pressed.

Reference [4] has more details on operation, most of which apply to
this design.

etc.

CIRCUIT DETAILS

For the latest design, refer to the EasyEDA project (schematic and
PCB) in reference [1].

The SSH circuit is similar to the "Woodpecker" Tuning Aid in reference
[2]. The CW circuit is very similar to the commercially sold Ameritron
ATP-102 (see references [3] and [4]).

Voltage regulator U1 converts a 9 volt battery to the 5 volts needed
by U1. U2 doesn't strictly require 5 volts but is run from the same
supply.

U1 forms an oscillator which a short duty cycle. The output level
is adjusted by R2, and reaches close to 5 volts peak to peak.
[TODO: Show typical output waveform from an oscilloscope.]

U2 forms an stable oscillator which adjustable frequency and duty
cycle. It drives MOSFET switches Q1 and Q2.
[TODO: Show typical output waveform from an oscilloscope.]

Current drain is about 15 mA (with no power LED and no load). A 9 volt
battery should last for a few years of occasional use.

ASSEMBLY TIPS

See reference [1] for the full schematic, parts list, and PCB layout.

You probably want to mount the unit in a case. There are mounting
holes on each corner of the PCB. The switches, output jacks, and power
LED can be mounted on the case.

The LED is optional. You can omit it and resistor R11 to extend the
battery life. The value of R11 an be adjusted for the desired
brightness for the particular type of LED being used.

SW 2 is optional and can be omitted if you don't need the option to
key the CW transmitter fully on.

You can choose to omit SW3 and SW4 and jumper them, and make SW1 a
momentary pushbutton that turns on both circuits when pressed.

The three pots can full sized units mounted on the outside of a case
or trimpots mounted on the PCB that are adjusted once as desired and
left internal to the case.

Use whatever jacks you want for P1 and P2. Phono jacks are convenient
and inexpensive. Be sure to insulate P2 from ground (mounting it on a
metal case could ground it). Don't ground the SSB output and the KEY
output by using them at the same time which a transmitter where both
connections have a ground connection. If you only need to switch
postive CW keying voltages, you can omit Q2 and solder a jumper
between ts source and rain pads. In this case the ground of connector
P2 will be at chassis ground, the same as P1.

You can adjust the component values in the SSB circuit if you want
different pulse frequency or duty cycle.

You can breadboard the circuit, construct it using Manhattan or Ugly
style, or have a PCB commercially made.

KNOWN ISSUES

The unit has not yet been tested by me with many models of
transmitter.

FUTURE WORK

I have not yet received PCBs and so have not been able to verify that
the PCB layout is correct.
